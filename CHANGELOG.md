## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Thinking labels feature that prefixes AI reasoning blocks with themed "Thinking:" labels for better readability

### Changed
- Rewrote README.md with professional documentation standards
- Added comprehensive feature documentation, configuration reference, and usage examples
- Simplified settings modal by removing less-used advanced options (expandedPreviewMaxLines, diffSplitMinWidth, diffCollapsedLines, tool ownership toggles)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Auto-detection of MCP and RTK capabilities to conditionally expose related UI/config controls.

### Changed
- `/tool-display` modal now hides MCP settings when MCP tooling is unavailable.
- `/tool-display` modal now hides RTK compaction hint settings when RTK optimizer is unavailable.
- Runtime rendering now force-disables MCP output mode and RTK hint rendering when those capabilities are unavailable.
- Native user message box is now user-configurable via `enableNativeUserMessageBox` in config and `/tool-display` settings.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Added per-tool ownership config via `registerToolOverrides` for `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`, `edit`, and `write` so users can avoid tool ownership conflicts with other extensions.
- Added settings modal toggles for built-in tool ownership and `/reload` guidance when ownership changes.
- Added backward-compatible config migration from legacy `registerReadToolOverride` to `registerToolOverrides.read`.

### Changed
- Built-in tool override registration is now conditional per tool based on ownership settings.
- Updated README configuration/troubleshooting docs for multi-tool extension compatibility.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Corrected `write` call rendering state handling so path changes without new content no longer reuse stale line/size metadata from previous writes.
- Restored write call suffix rendering (`(X lines, Y)`) when content is available, improving call summary consistency.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Reorganized repository layout to a cleaner package structure:
  - moved implementation modules to `src/`
  - moved screenshot assets to `assets/`
  - moved example config to `config/`
  - kept root `index.ts` as stable Pi auto-discovery entrypoint.
- Simplified TypeScript build command to use `tsconfig.json` project mode.
- Updated README installation heading now that npm package is published.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Public repository scaffolding (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`).
- Package metadata for public distribution (`keywords`, `files`, `license`, `publishConfig`, engine constraints).
- Vendored `zellij-modal.ts` to keep this extension self-contained as a standalone repository.

### Changed
- Updated `config-modal.ts` to use local `zellij-modal.ts` import.
- Updated build script to include `zellij-modal.ts`.
