## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Corrected `write` call rendering state handling so path changes without new content no longer reuse stale line/size metadata from previous writes.
- Restored write call suffix rendering (`(X lines, Y)`) when content is available, improving call summary consistency.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Reorganized repository layout to a cleaner package structure:
  - moved implementation modules to `src/`
  - moved screenshot assets to `assets/`
  - moved example config to `config/`
  - kept root `index.ts` as stable Pi auto-discovery entrypoint.
- Simplified TypeScript build command to use `tsconfig.json` project mode.
- Updated README installation heading now that npm package is published.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Public repository scaffolding (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`).
- Package metadata for public distribution (`keywords`, `files`, `license`, `publishConfig`, engine constraints).
- Vendored `zellij-modal.ts` to keep this extension self-contained as a standalone repository.

### Changed
- Updated `config-modal.ts` to use local `zellij-modal.ts` import.
- Updated build script to include `zellij-modal.ts`.
